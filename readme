Environment Set Up
	* Use the Docker container containing Jupyter Notebook from the earlier Labs

Usage
	
	Naive-Bayes
		*
	
	Random Forest
		*
	
	SVM
		* Co-locate `enron_spam_data.csv` with the `project_svm-linear.ipynb` and `project_svm-rbd.ipynb` notebook files
		* SVM with Linear Kernel
			* Run each section sequentially up to and including the section containing `# Define the target variable`
			* Run either the section with the 200MB cache size or the section with the 1000MB cache size
			* Continue running each section sequentially to get and visualize the results
		* SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel
			* Run each section sequentially up to and including the section containing `# Define the target variable`
			* Skip running the next two sections for running and evaluating the RBF kernel with a C value of 0.75
			* Run the section for the RBF kernel with a C of 1.0 and its following evaluation section
			* Skip running the next two sections for running and evaluating the RBF kernel with a C value of 1.25
			* Continue running each section sequentially to get and visualize the results
